I know Apple doesn&#8217;t really do well when it comes to social\nservices, but I&#8217;m wondering if a simple photo sharing site might\nnot be impossible for them to do well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about this ever since Mueller posted this a week ago. I think this could be great. At a technical level, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/eddy-cue-200k-imessages-per-second-2016-2\">iMessage shows</a> that Apple can build a system that scales. The biggest problem I can think of is usernames. Apple IDs don&#8217;t have to be icloud.com / me.com / mac.com usernames &#8212; you can use any email address. And you wouldn&#8217;t want to expose your email and iMessage address publicly. But Game Center uses nicknames to avoid the same problem. Apple could either piggyback on Game Center nicknames, or set up a new namespace of nicknames for this hypothetical Instagram clone.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"http://shapeof.com/archives/2018/4/apple_instagram_clone.html\">shapeof.com/archives/2018/4/apple_instagram_clone.html</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Other component makers\nfor Apple, which reports quarterly earnings results next week,\nhave also issued gloomy outlooks pointing to lackluster demand for\nthe top-end phone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Starting to sound like iPhone X sales really are falling short of expectations. You often can&#8217;t judge iPhone sales from the perspective of a component maker, because Apple could have switched to another company for the same component. But these flexible OLED displays <em>only</em> come from Samsung. Apple reports earnings for the first calendar quarter on Tuesday.</p>\n\n<p>My spitball theory: the iPhone X is not &#8220;too expensive&#8221;, but it is too expensive for mass market casual phone buyers. <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/02/apple-reports-its-holiday-2017-earnings-today/\">iPhone sales always peak in the fourth calendar quarter</a> by a large margin, for two reasons: (1) it&#8217;s the holiday quarter, so anyone buying an iPhone as a gift is going to buy it in November or December; and (2) that&#8217;s the first full quarter when new top-tier iPhones debut, and enthusiasts buy them as soon as they can. <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/02/01/tim-cook-iphone-x-top-selling-iphone-every-week-since-it-shipped-in-november\">iPhone X sales were great in the holiday quarter</a>, but perhaps the enthusiasm of the early adopter crowd isn&#8217;t shared by the mass market.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps I&#8217;m just stating the obvious here &#8212; the existence of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus indicates that Apple anticipated the need for brand new high-end iPhones in the $700-800 price range. Assuming they keep going with the new $1000-1100 tier, those phones might be even <em>more</em> biased toward the holiday quarter than other iPhones.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/989929634887237634\">M.G. Siegler</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Good points, and the flip side of why the iPhones 8 didn’t sell as\nwell out of the gate: the early-adopters/die-hard were waiting for\nX. In an ideal world, the releases would have been inverted (X\nfirst, 8 a couple months later).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-26/samsung-sees-slow-demand-for-oleds-used-for-apple-s-iphone-x\">bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-26/samsung-sees-slow…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

The CGS method reportedly results in a display that&#8217;s\nlighter and more shock resistant.</p>\n\n<p>With this display technology, Apple will add a thin-film sensor to\nthe touch film sensor included in the CGS, but the purpose of the\nnew layer is unknown. It will, however, result in a 15 percent\nincrease in the cost of the touch panel, resulting in a higher\npurchase price of $23 to $26.</p>\n\n<p>To offset the cost of the new display it plans to use, Kuo\nbelieves Apple will remove the 3D Touch functionality on the\n6.1-inch iPhone, which would be a curious move as 3D Touch is\nwell-integrated throughout the operating system that runs on the\niPhone at this point.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t generally link to rumors like this, but this one caught my eye because I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about 3D Touch lately. 3D Touch is the sort of feature that either needs to be on <em>all</em> iPhones or else should be dropped. If it&#8217;s not pervasive across the entire platform, developers can&#8217;t count on it. I think that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s underutilized today. But it&#8217;s one thing to wait for older iPhones from the pre-3D Touch era to drop out of usage. It&#8217;s another for Apple to sell a brand new phone in 2018 without it. I&#8217;m not going to rant and rave about something that&#8217;s only a rumor &#8212; but if September rolls around and Apple ships this new phone without 3D Touch to save a few measly dollars, I&#8217;m going to rant and rave.</p>\n\n<p>I also think it&#8217;s a serious problem that iPhones have 3D Touch and iPads don&#8217;t, yet iPads are stuck running an OS where 3D Touch is the way to bring up a contextual shortcut menu, but that&#8217;s a different rant.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/04/26/kuo-no-3d-touch-6-1-inch-2018-iphone/\">macrumors.com/2018/04/26/kuo-no-3d-touch-6-1-inch-2018…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

You just wrote to, say, <code>scratchpad.foo</code> or <code>examples.bar</code> or any other unique identifier and whatever you wrote would be there when you went to read it. And, even better, there was a visual interface for exploring everything in the object database. You could see it and explore it, because in addition to being a language, Frontier was also a real Mac app. You could even customize the app&#8217;s menu items just by editing the <code>system.misc.menubar</code> table in the object database. It&#8217;s a wonderfully self-contained design. <a href=\"http://scripting.com/frontier/manual/chapter06.html\">Re-reading the documentation</a> makes me wonder why there&#8217;s nothing like Frontier&#8217;s object database in other scripting languages.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"http://scripting.com/2018/04/18/164609.html\">scripting.com/2018/04/18/164609.html</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Nintendo cannot\npatch the hardware flaw without releasing a new version of the\nSwitch, which means that at least 14 million devices are\nvulnerable.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a jailbreak that’s similar to a “tethered” iPhone jailbreak,\nmeaning it needs to be performed on every boot via USB.

While touch is\npowerful specifically because of your ability to directly\nmanipulate the software you’re using, keyboards must first be\npointed at a place that needs text. They need focus. And here’s\nwhere the iPad falls down.</p>\n\n<p>It has no concept of focus. Or rather, it obviously does, but its\ndesigners are in denial about it. Keyboard focus is littered\nthroughout the platform, from the presence of a cursor when\ninputting text, to the software keyboard auto-hiding when no text\nfield is in use. When you’re producing text, this generally works\npretty well.</p>\n\n<p>But the keyboard is used for far more than typing. Whether it’s\ncommand-tabbing between applications or using shortcuts within\nthem, the keyboard is a critical control device. And it just does\nnot work right on the iPad.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gruber/status/987774563558838272\">I tweeted about this same thing</a> over the weekend, while testing out <a href=\"http://matias.ca/laptoppro/mac/\">a new keyboard</a> that Jason Snell <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsnell/status/986691168644689920\">convinced me to buy</a>. It seems crazy to me the iPad lets you command-tab between full-screen apps, but when you&#8217;re in split screen mode there&#8217;s (a) no way to switch between the apps on screen using the keyboard, and (b) no indication of which app has keyboard focus.</p>\n\n<p>Off the top of my head, I think command-tab switching should include the individual apps in split screen mode.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://medium.com/@lkanies/apple-has-a-focus-problem-8a1acee28b7d\">medium.com/@lkanies/apple-has-a-focus-problem-8a1acee28b7d</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Google\nhas been quietly corralling every major cellphone carrier on the\nplanet into adopting technology to replace SMS. It’s going to be\ncalled “Chat,” and it’s based on a standard called the “Universal\nProfile for Rich Communication Services.” SMS is the default that\neverybody has to fall back to, and so Google’s goal is to make\nthat default texting experience on an Android phone as good as\nother modern messaging apps.</p>\n\n<p>As part of that effort, Google says it’s “pausing” work on its\nmost recent entry into the messaging space, Allo. It’s the sort of\n“pause” that involves transferring almost the entire team off the\nproject and putting all its resources into another app, Android\nMessages. [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>But remember, Chat is a carrier-based service, not a Google\nservice. It’s just “Chat,” not “Google Chat.” In a sign of its\nstrategic importance to Google, the company has spearheaded\ndevelopment on the new standard, so that every carrier’s Chat\nservices will be interoperable. But, like SMS, Chat won’t be\nend-to-end encrypted, and it will follow the same legal\nintercept standards. In other words: it won’t be as secure as\niMessage or Signal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is unconscionable for Google to back a new protocol that isn&#8217;t end-to-end encrypted. End-to-end encryption is table stakes for any new communication platform today.

On\nits pages, she had sketched, in pink marker, a series of icons to\nrepresent the commands that Hertzfeld’s software would execute.\nEach square represented a pixel. A pointing finger meant “Paste.”\nA paintbrush symbolized “MacPaint.” Scissors said “Cut.” Kare told\nme about this origin moment: “As soon as I started work, Andy\nHertzfeld wrote an icon editor and font editor so I could design\nimages and letterforms using the Mac, not paper,” she said. “But I\nloved the puzzle-like nature of working in 16&#8201;&#215;&#8201;16 and 32&#8201;&#215;&#8201;32\npixel icon grids, and the marriage of craft and metaphor.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Susan Kare deserves every award in the world.

The repair shop also declined the repair, but\ntheir reason was allegedly that Apple has yet to offer the\nrequired certification courses to service the iMac Pro.</p>\n\n<p>However, Apple&#8217;s internal iMac Pro Service Readiness Guide\nobtained by MacRumors states that <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206048\">ATLAS online training and\nlearning resources</a> for servicing the iMac Pro have been\navailable in English since December. We also spoke to multiple\nsources who completed the course and received certification\nmonths ago.</p>\n\n<p>The guide adds that iMac Pro service parts availability began in\nearly to mid January, with replacement logic boards, flash\nstorage, and memory available by late February. Multiple sources\nat Apple Authorized Service Providers also confirmed that iMac Pro\ndisplays are available with two-week-or-less delivery estimates.</p>\n\n<p>MacRumors contacted a reliable source who confirmed that Apple\nAuthorized Service Providers are permitted to deny service for any\nproduct that has been opened or modified by a customer, regardless\nof warranty, both for safety reasons and to avoid responsibility\nif the machine cannot be fixed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sebastian&#8217;s video about his saga is deeply disingenuous &#8212; he makes it sound as though Apple isn&#8217;t able to repair any iMac Pro with a damaged display. As Rossignol&#8217;s reporting makes clear, that&#8217;s not true. On the surface it does sound wrong that Apple refuses to repair Sebastian&#8217;s iMac Pro, even though he&#8217;s willing to pay for it. But in car terms, Apple is saying his iMac is totaled.

Why? Because the iPhone X is dead,&#8221; Campling wrote in\nhis note.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;The simple problem with X is that it is too expensive,&#8221; Campling\ntold CNBC by phone on Friday, talking about the device&#8217;s $999\nprice tag. &#8220;Consumers are turning their backs on high-priced\nsmartphones.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It might be true that the iPhone X will be discontinued in September when new iPhones are announced, but I guarantee it will be replaced by a successor. It actually makes sense that Apple wouldn&#8217;t keep the iPhone X around for another year at a lower price &#8212; that&#8217;s the iPhone 8&#8217;s role.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know why CNBC is paying credence to Campling on this, because by all accounts the iPhone X is selling well or very well. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/01/cnbc-transcript-apple-ceo-tim-cook-speaks-with-cnbc.html\">Tim Cook told CNBC in February</a> that &#8220;iPhone X was our most popular iPhone, despite not beginning to ship until November.&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/iphone-x-alone-generated-35-total-handset-industry-profits-q4-2017/\">A report this week from Counterpoint</a> claims the iPhone X alone accounted for 35 percent of all profits in the industry in Q4 2017 &#8212; even though it only went on sale in November. (The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus combined for 34 percent; all iPhones combined accounted for 86 percent. I don&#8217;t know how much credence to give to Counterpoint&#8217;s report because I don&#8217;t know their methodology, but if their numbers are even vaguely accurate, Apple has almost no competition in the premium handset market. Samsung&#8217;s top two phones combined account for less than 5 percent of industry profits, and no other company had a phone that cracked the top 10.)</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/20/apple-iphone-x-discontinued-this-year-analyst-says.html\">cnbc.com/2018/04/20/apple-iphone-x-discontinued-this-year…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Kubrick had\nseen exhibits at the 1964 World’s Fair, and pored over a magazine\narticle titled “Home of the Future.” The lead production designer\non the film, Tony Masters, noticed that the world of <em>2001</em>\neventually became a distinct time and place, with the kind of\ncoherent aesthetic that would merit a sweeping historical label,\nlike “Georgian” or “Victorian.” “We designed a way to live,” he\nrecalled, “down to the last knife and fork.” (The Arne Jacobsen\nflatware, designed in 1957, was made famous by its use in the\nfilm, and is still in production.) By rendering a not-too-distant\nfuture, Kubrick set himself up for a test: thirty-three years\nlater, his audiences would still be around to grade his\npredictions. Part of his genius was that he understood how to rig\nthe results. Many elements from his set designs were contributions\nfrom major brands &#8212; Whirlpool, Macy’s, DuPont, Parker Pens, Nikon\n&#8212; which quickly cashed in on their big-screen exposure. If 2001\nthe year looked like <em>2001</em> the movie, it was partly because the\nfilm’s imaginary design trends were made real.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/23/2001-a-space-odyssey-what-it-means-and-how-it-was-made\">newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/23/2001-a-space-odyssey-what…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Even\nbeyond the Mac, anyone who has clicked on a File menu in one\nplatform has a pretty good shot at guessing where a Save command\nmight be when provided a File menu somewhere else. Likewise and\nalso regardless of operating system, someone presented with an\nentirely new application can safely open and explore menus to try\nand locate features they might need. Never pivoted data before,\nbut need to for the first time? Hey look, there’s a menu in the\nbar called Data! Finally, let’s say that same seemingly one-time\noperation becomes a regular course of action that is needed\nmultiple times a day. The best menu bars provide an equivalent\nkeyboard shortcut right next to the command so, for example,\nanyone can discover how to save using command &#8212; s without having\nto be told.</p>\n\n<p>So then why are menu bars fading out of more modern UX\nconventions?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Such a great piece. The menu bar, in my opinion, is the single biggest reason why Mac apps can grow to a greater manageable complexity than iOS apps. I&#8217;m not saying iOS should get a menu bar &#8212; I&#8217;m saying this is why it makes sense for Apple to maintain its dual platform strategy.

For one thing,\nit’s one of Apple’s own apps. For another, it was first released\nin 2005, making it almost 13 years old, though it hasn’t seen an\nupdate in about 8 years.</p>\n\n<p>But despite its age and the fact that the writing was on the wall\nfor QuickTime 7, news that it wouldn’t see an update when macOS\nmakes the jump to all-64-bit-all-the-time sparked some cries of\nfrustration from users, including both myself and Jason, who have\ncarved out a place in their workflows &#8212; and their hearts &#8212; for\nthis little anachronism.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest reason that people are up in arms about the death of\nQuickTime 7 Pro is that its successor, QuickTime Player X, never\nquite filled its shoes when it came to features.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I still use QuickTime 7 Pro, too &#8212; I have it set as my default app to open any video file. When I <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208436\">checked my list of installed apps looking for any remaining 32-bit hold-outs</a>, none of the apps I use regularly are 32-bit. But I spotted several irregularly used apps that are.</p>\n\n<p>This was not the case with iOS&#8217;s deprecation of 32-bit apps. With iOS, the only apps I lost use of were a few old games (including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2011/11/17/apple-removes-texas-holdem-its-only-ios-game-from-app-store/\">Apple&#8217;s own Texas Hold ’Em game</a>, which was really rather fun). With the Mac, I&#8217;ll be losing a few useful apps. But that was true of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple%27s_transition_to_Intel_processors\">PowerPC to Intel transition</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.storiesofapple.net/the-68k-ppc-transition-and-snow-leopard-comparing-apples-to-oranges.html\">Motorola 68K to PowerPC transition</a>. I vaguely recall some software that ran under System 6 but broke under System 7 in 1991. This is the price we pay for a platform that remains both relevant and (at least compared to Windows) low-cruft.</p>\n\n<p>What makes QuickTime 7 Pro particularly irksome, as Moren points out, is that it&#8217;s Apple&#8217;s own software and Apple has resolutely refused to address QuickTime X&#8217;s deficiencies for over a decade, so nobody expects to <em>ever</em> see a full replacement for QuickTime Pro. Maybe there&#8217;s an opportunity here for a third-party app to take up the mantle &#8212; but if that hasn&#8217;t happened in the last decade, I&#8217;m not too hopeful about it happening now.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2018/04/a-tale-of-two-quicktimes/\">sixcolors.com/post/2018/04/a-tale-of-two-quicktimes/</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Most of iOS 9&#8217;s new features\nseem to be squarely aimed at Apple&#8217;s biggest rival in mobile:\nAndroid. Specifically, they were about catching up to Android.</p>\n\n<p>Search improvements, proactive assistance, split screen, and\ntransit directions? It&#8217;s been done, but the differences are the\nfun part, so we chased down the new iOS 9 screenshots and compared\nthem to their Android counterparts. It&#8217;s not just about who copied\nwhom; it&#8217;s also a chance to look at the different designs of the\ntwo operating systems. And hey, Apple isn&#8217;t the only one taking\nideas from a competitor. Android M&#8217;s selectable app permissions\nare an exact copy of the iOS model.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is not copying. Following? Sure. That&#8217;s how competition works. I&#8217;m not arguing that if Company A implements a certain feature first, that no other company can ever implement that feature without ripping off Company A. Look at the side-by-side screenshots in Amadeo&#8217;s article. Were all these features on Android first? Sure. Do any of these screenshots leave even one iota of confusion regarding which is iOS and which is Android? No. If you don&#8217;t see the difference between these examples and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2018/04/huawei-stage-lighting.jpg\">what Huawei did with their Portrait mode feature</a>, I don&#8217;t know what to say. There&#8217;s a difference between copying an idea and copying an implementation of that idea.</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why I like the phrase &#8220;design plagiarism&#8221;. Maybe you think Amadeo&#8217;s examples do constitute &#8220;copying&#8221;. But they&#8217;re not plagiarism. If you write an article, and then I write my own article about the same topic, that just means you were first. But if I copy your article and just change a few words, that&#8217;s plagiarism. There&#8217;s a big difference.<sup id=\"fnr1-2018-04-17\"><a href=\"#fn1-2018-04-17\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2018-04-17\">\n<p>This, by the way, is why I&#8217;ve always felt Apple&#8217;s misguided &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Computer,_Inc._v._Microsoft_Corp.\">look-and-feel&#8221; lawsuit against Microsoft</a> in the mid-90&#8217;s was a huge mistake from the outset. Windows was clearly not a rip-off or copy of the Mac. There was no confusion which was which, and the Mac was elegant and Windows &#8212; especially pre-Windows 95 &#8212; was simply gross. Have you ever seen screenshots of <a href=\"https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win101\">Windows 1</a> <a href=\"https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win203\">or 2</a>? They&#8217;re so startlingly ugly it&#8217;s hard to believe they&#8217;re real. Even <a href=\"https://guidebookgallery.org/screenshots/win31\">Windows 3</a>, the first version that became popular, was seriously ugly. Apple wasn&#8217;t trying to prevent Microsoft from <em>copying</em> the Mac &#8212; they were trying to prevent Microsoft from using the basic idea of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)\">windows / icons / mouse pointer</a> GUI.

Huawei, the company that’s been shipping copycat Apple\nEarPods with its Android smartphones for years, has decided to\nalso clone Apple’s wireless AirPods, and the product of that is\ncalled <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/27/17167890/huawei-p20-launch-freebuds-wireless-earphones-price\">the Huawei FreeBuds</a>. I got my hands on the FreeBuds at\nHuawei’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/27/17165822/huawei-p20-pro-specs-price-release-date\">P20 launch event</a>, and I found myself pleasantly\nsurprised by their styling and comfort. Yes, Huawei is copying\nApple; but I’m not a patent lawyer, I just want to see good tech\nproliferate, and the FreeBuds look promising.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have so many problems with this. First, it&#8217;s not &#8220;tech companies blatantly copying each other’s designs&#8221; in the abstract. That phrasing makes it sound like everyone copies from everyone. What&#8217;s going on, and which Huawei exemplifies, is that device makers from China <a href=\"http://samsungcopiesapple.tumblr.com/\">and Korea</a> blatantly copy hardware and software from one company: Apple.</p>\n\n<p>In this case Savov was writing about Huawei&#8217;s copycat wireless earbuds. But the most telling example &#8212; which Savov himself <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/4/17077458/iphone-design-clones-mwc-2018\">has documented better than anyone else</a> &#8212; is the iPhone X notch. The notch is unquestionably the <em>worst</em> thing about the iPhone X design &#8212; it is a worthwhile compromise, but <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2017/09/iphone_x_event_thoughts_and_observations#iphone-x\">a severe and glaring one</a>. But it lends the iPhone X a distinctive look and <em>can</em> be easily copied, and so of course these companies are shamelessly copying it. Anything they can copy from a successful Apple product, they do. (How many PC laptops look like MacBooks?)</p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a software example, from the same Huawei launch event last month: <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2018/04/huawei-stage-lighting.jpg\">their camera app&#8217;s Portrait mode with a &#8220;Stage Lighting&#8221; effect</a>. Huawei didn&#8217;t just copy the feature &#8212; they copied Apple&#8217;s UI almost to a T. (Apple uses a 3D wireframe cube to indicate the currently selected lighting effect; Huawei uses a 3D wireframe sphere.) This is design plagiarism.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think <em>outrage</em> is the right term for how the media should react to such rip-offs. I suggest a mix of contempt and mockery. But they certainly shouldn&#8217;t be pooh-poohed with an &#8220;<em>Eh, everyone does it</em>&#8221; attitude. Everyone does <em>not</em> do it, and the companies who do original design work are not each ripped off in equal measure.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

After that, they are disconnected from the\ndevice, but are not yet cracked. Some time later, the phones will\ndisplay a black screen with the passcode, among other information.\nThe exact length of time varies, taking about two hours in the\nobservations of our source. It can take up to three days or longer\nfor six-digit passcodes, according to Grayshift documents, and the\ntime needed for longer passphrases is not mentioned. Even disabled\nphones can be unlocked, according to Grayshift.</p>\n\n<p>After the device is unlocked, the full contents of the filesystem\nare downloaded to the GrayKey device. From there, they can be\naccessed through a web-based interface on a connected computer,\nand downloaded for analysis.

I suggest skipping Gurman&#8217;s summary of the memo and scrolling down to the memo itself. Curiously, Gurman doesn&#8217;t say when the memo was posted and he omits its headline. I&#8217;ve heard the memo was posted on Monday this week, and the headline was &#8220;The Impact of Leaks&#8221;. Some observations, starting with the opening:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Last month, Apple caught and fired the employee responsible for\nleaking details from an internal, confidential meeting about\nApple’s software roadmap. Hundreds of software engineers were in\nattendance, and thousands more within the organization received\ndetails of its proceedings. One person betrayed their trust.</p>\n\n<p>The employee who leaked the meeting to a reporter later told Apple\ninvestigators that he did it because he thought he wouldn’t be\ndiscovered. But people who leak &#8212; whether they’re Apple\nemployees, contractors or suppliers &#8212; do get caught and they’re\ngetting caught faster than ever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Gurman doesn&#8217;t mention that the meeting was leaked to Gurman himself &#8212; the person who leaked <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-30/apple-is-said-to-push-back-some-key-iphone-software-features\">this story</a> was caught and fired. I can see why Gurman and Bloomberg might not want to emphasize that.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Investments by Apple have had an enormous impact on the company’s\nability to identify and catch leakers. Just before last\nSeptember’s special event, an employee leaked a link to the gold\nmaster of iOS 11 to the press, again believing he wouldn’t be\ncaught. The unreleased OS detailed soon-to-be-announced software\nand hardware including iPhone X. Within days, the leaker was\nidentified through an internal investigation and fired.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The iOS 11 GM leak <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/09/appl-iphone-8-iphone-8-plus-iphone-x/\">revealed the name &#8220;iPhone X&#8221;</a>. It also confirmed features like Face ID and wireless charging, but the name was the big one. Face ID and wireless charging had been rumored for a year, but until that leak just three days before the event, we had no idea what Apple was going to call its new phones. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Global Security’s digital forensics also helped catch several\nemployees who were feeding confidential details about new products\nincluding iPhone X, iPad Pro and AirPods to a blogger at 9to5Mac.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear which stories at 9to5Mac this is about, but the AirPods story is probably <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2016/01/08/iphone-7-wireless-headphones-beats/\">this one</a>, which was a huge scoop published 9 months before AirPods were announced &#8212; by none other than Mark Gurman. It seems possible that every single specific example cited by Apple in this memo was someone leaking to Mark Gurman. Makes you wonder who had the balls to send this memo to him. We&#8217;ll be getting into <em>Inception</em> territory if the leaker of the memo on leakers getting fired for leaking to Gurman gets fired for leaking it to Gurman.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Leakers do not simply lose their jobs at Apple. In some cases,\nthey face jail time and massive fines for network intrusion and\ntheft of trade secrets both classified as federal crimes. In 2017,\nApple caught 29 leakers. 12 of those were arrested. Among those\nwere Apple employees, contractors and some partners in Apple’s\nsupply chain. These people not only lose their jobs, they can face\nextreme difficulty finding employment elsewhere. “The potential\ncriminal consequences of leaking are real,” says Tom Moyer of\nGlobal Security, “and that can become part of your personal and\nprofessional identity forever.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Getting fired for leaking &#8212; we all knew that happened. But this is the first I&#8217;ve heard of leakers being prosecuted criminally and going to jail. Apple is not fucking around regarding leaks.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

         "content_html" : "\n<p>During a break in Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s testimony before Congress yesterday, Zuckerberg inexplicably left his prepared notes &#8212; PR-approved talking points for anticipated lines of questioning &#8212; behind on the table. Associated Press photographer Andrew Harnik snapped a photo of them before a Facebook aide could close them, and it was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/becket/status/983846618263891968\">widely shared on Twitter</a>. The AP&#8217;s Behind the News site has <a href=\"https://blog.ap.org/behind-the-news/how-i-got-that-photo-of-zuckerbergs-notes\">a piece today on how Harnik got the shot</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Once I was able to sit down at the end of the event and see the\nresponse from Twitter and read what was in Zuckerberg’s notes, I\nrealized this was pretty important information. I read some\nresponses on Twitter &#8212; the photo was congratulated and celebrated\nby many fellow journalists, while others thought it was an\ninvasion of privacy. Others simply saw the irony of someone’s\nnotes being shared so publicly during a major congressional\nhearing on data privacy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The section in the talking points that got my attention, as well as that of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaxTemkin/status/983865019136954368\">many others</a>, regarded Tim Cook and Apple. It never actually came up during his testimony, but Zuckerberg and Facebook were clearly anticipating questions pertaining to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/03/28/tim-cook-mark-zuckerberg-comments/\">Tim Cook&#8217;s recent remarks on Facebook&#8217;s business model and privacy</a>. Basically, the whole &#8220;<em>If you&#8217;re not the customer, then you&#8217;re the product</em>&#8221; argument.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the section from Zuckerberg&#8217;s notes, verbatim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tim Cook on biz model</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bezos: &#8220;Companies that work hard to charge you more and\ncompanies that work hard to charge you less.&#8221;</li>\n<li>At FB, we try hard to charge you less. In fact, we&#8217;re free.</li>\n<li>[On data, we&#8217;re similar. When you install an app on your iPhone,\nyou give it access to some information, just like when you login\nwith FB.</li>\n<li>Lots of stories about apps misusing Apple data, never seen Apple\nnotify people.</li>\n<li>Important to hold everyone to the same standard.]</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Zuckerberg used the first two points &#8212; citing <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/mobile/2011/09/28/amazons-bezos-we-worked-hard-to-charge-you-less-for-kindle-fire/\">Jeff Bezos&#8217;s quote about there being two types of companies</a>, and asserting that Facebook is decidedly on the &#8220;working hard to charge you less&#8221; side of that equation &#8212; when he was asked about Cook&#8217;s remarks during his (excellent) <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/4/2/17185052/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-interview-fake-news-bots-cambridge\">podcast interview with Vox&#8217;s Ezra Klein</a> last week. The speciousness of that defense was the subject of <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/04/users_and_customers\">the column I wrote last week</a>, so I don&#8217;t need to cover it here.</p>\n\n<p>The other three points &#8212; hoo-boy. To be fair, these are only prepared notes. Zuckerberg didn&#8217;t say them, and we don&#8217;t know if he would have if questioned about Cook&#8217;s remarks. So it&#8217;s not fair to treat them as though they&#8217;re actually quotes from Zuckerberg.<sup id=\"fnr1-2018-04-11\"><a href=\"#fn1-2018-04-11\">1</a></sup> But what a pile of horseshit they would have been if he had.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On data, we&#8217;re similar. When you install an app on your iPhone,\nyou give it access to some information, just like when you login [<em>sic</em>]\nwith FB.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is almost nothing similar about how Apple and Facebook treat user data. Installing an app on an iPhone is nothing like signing in to Facebook. Yes, apps on iOS do get access to <em>some</em> data. But anything remotely private is only accessible to apps after the user has granted explicit permission for this access, and such access is also easily and clearly revokable in the Settings app&#8217;s Privacy section. Apple provides the user with clear control.</p>\n\n<p>As for where Zuckerberg might have gone with the item about &#8220;Lots of stories about apps misusing Apple data&#8221;, I&#8217;m not sure what that&#8217;s about. Maybe something like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2012/2/7/2782947/path-ios-app-user-information-collected-privacy\">the 2012 story where the now-nearly-forgotten app Path was caught uploading users&#8217; entire contacts database to their servers</a>? That was bad for user privacy, and Apple can be blamed for having allowed apps to access the address book without the user&#8217;s permission. But Apple responded, quickly, by making access to the address book something that required the user&#8217;s permission. (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/17/2879207/os-x-10-8-mountain-lion-privacy\">They made the same change on MacOS too</a>.) </p>\n\n<p>Apple was, at worst, naive about what apps would do with unfettered access to users&#8217; address books. Facebook is facing criticism today &#8212; <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2018/4/10/17220060/facebook-trust-major-tech-company\">and losing its users&#8217; trust</a> &#8212; not because they&#8217;ve been naive about privacy, but because they&#8217;ve been devious about it.</p>\n\n<p>Nobody is arguing that Apple collects too much data about users. If anything, I see some people arguing the opposite: that Apple is falling behind in the machine learning race because they don&#8217;t collect and aggregate <em>enough</em> data. And as for third-party apps collecting privacy-invasive data from devices, we now know that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/03/facebook-scraped-call-text-message-data-for-years-from-android-phones/\">Facebook has been collecting phone call and SMS messaging history from Android devices</a> &#8212; but not iOS, because iOS has <em>never</em> allowed third-party apps access to phone call or text messaging data.</p>\n\n<p>Zuckerberg should stick to the &#8220;some companies work hard to charge you more, other work hard to charge you less&#8221; angle. Trying to argue that Apple is in the same boat as Facebook on the privacy front is simply laughable.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2018-04-11\">\n<p>I&#8217;m curious about the brackets that surround the last three points.

         "content_html" : "\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-insists-iphone-users-enroll-in-apple-pay-with-a-red-badge-that-wont-go-away-1522753200?mod=e2tw\">Tripp Mickle, writing for The Wall Street Journal</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Inc. is nagging iPhone users to enroll in its mobile-payment\nservice with a persistent red circle badge. The strategy has\nworked with some, but is irritating others who say it is\nheavy-handed and exploits the tech giant’s clout in ways that\ncould disadvantage rivals.</p>\n\n<p>The tactic, part of the iPhone’s latest operating software\nlaunched last fall, is subtle. Users who opt not to input\ncredit-card information for Apple Pay when setting up their phones\nnow constantly see the red circle over their settings icon,\nindicating their setup is incomplete. Some users also periodically\nget notification reminders that go away only once they start the\nenrollment process.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mickle has a point here. This does annoy people who, for whatever reason, don&#8217;t want to set up Apple Pay. <a href=\"https://m.imore.com/how-stop-apple-pay-pestering-you\">There is a way to dismiss the red badge</a>, but it&#8217;s not obvious how, because the button you have to tap says &#8220;Set Up Apple Pay&#8221;. (After that, you tap &#8220;Cancel&#8221; or &#8220;Set Up Later in Wallet&#8221;.) It is inscrutably counterintuitive to need to tap a button that says &#8220;Set Up Apple Pay&#8221; when your intention is to stop being nagged to set it up because you <em>don&#8217;t want to set up Apple Pay</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But the Journal article never explains that you can turn off this red badge. As Mickle tells it, the only way to turn off the badge is to sign up for Apple Pay. That&#8217;s just wrong, and renders the remainder of his article moot.</p>\n\n<p>In act 2, the article turns weird:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Though payment analysts say the service speeds up checkout times\nand is more secure than traditional cards, Apple Pay has struggled\nto earn broad adoption in the U.S. Many remain skeptical that it\nis more secure, including Jack Frederick, a 29-year-old\nprofessional comedian from Queens, N.Y., who prefers using his\ncredit card directly.</p>\n\n<p>“This is the most aggressive they’ve ever been,” said Mr.\nFrederick, who has had a red badge over his iPhone settings since\nupdating his software in mid-January. He said the notification has\nmade him consider trading his iPhone 6 for a Google Pixel. “All\nthat from one dot,” he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Experts say using Apple Pay is faster and more secure than using a credit card, but here&#8217;s a 29-year-old comedian who thinks otherwise. Who wouldn&#8217;t take credit card security advice from a completely random guy on the street?</p>\n\n<p>I do think Apple has a marketing problem with Apple Pay, though. I can tell from talking to family members that a lot of people just don&#8217;t see why they should try Apple Pay, because they have no idea how it works or why they&#8217;d want to use it. And I think they worry that because it&#8217;s new and sort of science-fiction-y it will make their credit card <em>more</em> likely to be hacked, when the truth is the opposite. I think Apple needs more ads that explain and demonstrate the convenience and indisputable security advantages of using Apple Pay instead of a credit card, and the extraordinary convenience of Apple Pay Cash. I can see how a lot of people think, &#8220;<em>Eh, I&#8217;ll just keep using my credit card</em>&#8221; when they&#8217;re paying for something in a retail store. But Apple Pay Cash could be enough to get these people to set up Apple Pay.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, in act three, Mickle takes things to the absurd:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Everyone is doing essentially the same trick,” said Roger Kay, an\nanalyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates. “It’s really\nantitrust behavior.”</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Kay compared Apple Pay setup badges and notifications to\nMicrosoft Corp. bundling its Internet Explorer browser with\nWindows in the 1990s &#8212; a strategy the Justice Department\nsuccessfully sued to stop on antitrust grounds saying it hurt\nrivals. “They used to have actual behavioral remedies and say you\ncan’t do this,” Mr. Kay said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a ridiculous comparison in several ways, but I&#8217;ll point out just one. With the benefit of 20 years of hindsight, it&#8217;s now clear that one aspect of Microsoft&#8217;s defense was correct: web browsers do belong built into operating systems at the system level. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2018/04/safari-required.png\">Good luck removing Safari</a> from MacOS or iOS. I wish you even better luck removing Chrome from a Chromebook.</p>\n\n<p>Netscape didn&#8217;t lose to IE because IE was built into Windows; it lost because IE was better. And when first Firefox and then Chrome came along, they thrived on Windows because they were better than IE.</p>\n\n<p>Apple Pay, as conceived, has to be built into the OS. By Kay&#8217;s argument, most of the built-in features in <em>any</em> OS are anticompetitive. What new features <em>could</em> be added to iOS without hurting some sort of <a href=\"https://justgetflux.com/ios.html\">competitor</a>?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple declined to comment on potential antitrust concerns.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Probably because they were stifling laughter.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

         "content_html" : "\n<p>Fascinating, wide-ranging podcast interview (with an excellent transcript) <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/4/2/17185052/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-interview-fake-news-bots-cambridge\">between Vox&#8217;s Ezra Klein and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Klein</strong>: One of the things that has been coming up a lot in the\nconversation is whether the business model of monetizing user\nattention is what is letting in a lot of these problems. Tim Cook,\nthe CEO of Apple, gave an interview the other day and he was asked\nwhat he would do if he was in your shoes. He said, “I wouldn’t be\nin this situation,” and argued that Apple sells products to users,\nit doesn’t sell users to advertisers, and so it’s a sounder\nbusiness model that doesn’t open itself to these problems.</p>\n\n<p>Do you think part of the problem here is the business model where\nattention ends up dominating above all else, and so anything that\ncan engage has powerful value within the ecosystem?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Zuckerberg</strong>: You know, I find that argument, that if you’re not\npaying that somehow we can’t care about you, to be extremely glib\nand not at all aligned with the truth. The reality here is that if\nyou want to build a service that helps connect everyone in the\nworld, then there are a lot of people who can’t afford to pay. And\ntherefore, as with a lot of media, having an advertising-supported\nmodel is the only rational model that can support building this\nservice to reach people. [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>But if you want to build a service which is not just serving rich\npeople, then you need to have something that people can afford. I\nthought Jeff Bezos had an excellent saying on this in one of his\nKindle launches a number of years back. He said, “There are\ncompanies that work hard to charge you more, and there are\ncompanies that work hard to charge you less.” And at Facebook, we\nare squarely in the camp of the companies that work hard to charge\nyou less and provide a free service that everyone can use.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t think at all that that means that we don’t care about\npeople. To the contrary, I think it’s important that we don’t all\nget Stockholm syndrome and let the companies that work hard to\ncharge you more convince you that they actually care more about\nyou. Because that sounds ridiculous to me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is certainly something to Zuckerberg&#8217;s argument here, but the speciousness of the way he formulates it is that a company working hard to charge you more money <em>is</em> undeniably incentivized to care more about you, <em>if</em> you can afford their product or service. I think it’s undeniable that Apple cares more about the hundreds of millions of people who buy its products than Facebook cares about any of its billions of users.</p>\n\n<p>The more apt Tim Cook quote that applies here <a href=\"https://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/tim-cook-to-google-users-youre-not-the-customer-youre-the-product-594242\">is this long-standing internet adage</a>: &#8220;When an online service is free, you&#8217;re not the customer. You&#8217;re the product.&#8221; Amazon is undeniably focused on low prices. But Facebook doesn&#8217;t charge low prices &#8212; they charge high prices. To their customers: advertisers. And <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/234056/facebooks-average-advertising-revenue-per-user/\">a cursory look at their financials</a> indicates they&#8217;ve been working hard to raise those prices.</p>\n\n<p>The linguistic trick Zuckerberg pulls here is that nowhere in the entire interview does he mention the words <em>user</em> or <em>customer</em>. He only says <em>you</em> (in the plural sense) and <em>people</em>. That&#8217;s a dodge, because unlike Apple &#8212; and Amazon &#8212; Facebook&#8217;s users are not its customers &#8212; and most of the controversies they are dealing with today all stem from the fact that they favored their customers (advertisers willing to pay ever-higher sums for ever-more-invasively-targeted ads) at the expense of their users.</p>\n\n\n\n    "
